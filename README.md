# Decision-Tree-Classifier-for-Fraud-Detection
This Python script builds a decision tree model to classify fraud cases based on taxable income (â‰¤30,000 = risky). It preprocesses data (one-hot encoding for categorical variables), splits into train/test sets (80/20), trains the model, and evaluates performance (accuracy, classification report).
